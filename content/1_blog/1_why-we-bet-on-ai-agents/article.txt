Intro: Most companies are adding AI as a feature. We built the entire company around it. Here's why autonomous agents are the highest-leverage bet in tech right now.

## The Shift

The AI landscape changed when models got good enough to reason through multi-step tasks. Not just answering questions — actually planning, executing, and iterating. That's when we stopped thinking of AI as a tool and started treating it as a teammate.

## Why Agents Over Models

A model gives you a response. An agent gives you an outcome. The difference is execution. Our agents break down complex objectives into sub-tasks, use tools, call APIs, handle errors, and deliver finished work — not suggestions.

## The Architecture

Every agent we build follows the same core loop: observe, plan, act, evaluate. The specifics change per domain, but the pattern holds. We pair this with robust logging, human-in-the-loop checkpoints, and automatic rollback when confidence drops below threshold.

## What's Next

We're pushing into multi-agent collaboration — systems where specialised agents hand off work to each other. One researches, another writes, another reviews. The compound effect is massive. This is where we're placing our next bet.
