Intro: Clean code isn't just about readability — it's about building software that can withstand the test of time, just like a well-designed building.

## Structural Integrity

In architecture, structural integrity means a building can support its intended loads. In software, it means your codebase can handle growth, change, and the unexpected without collapsing into technical debt.

## Blueprints and Patterns

Design patterns are the blueprints of software engineering. They provide proven solutions to common problems. But like architectural blueprints, they must be adapted to the specific context of each project.

## The Importance of White Space

Just as negative space in architecture creates breathing room and visual clarity, white space in code — proper spacing, clear naming, logical grouping — makes software more maintainable and easier to understand.

## Building for Maintenance

The best buildings are designed with maintenance in mind. Access panels, service corridors, and modular systems make repairs straightforward. The same principle applies to code: write it so that the next developer can understand and modify it without tearing down walls.
