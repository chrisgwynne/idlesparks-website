Intro: AI that works in a demo but fails in production is worthless. After processing over 10 million tasks, here's what we've learned about building AI systems that actually hold up.

## Demos Lie

Every AI demo looks impressive. Cherry-picked inputs, controlled conditions, perfect lighting. Production is different. Users send malformed data, edge cases stack up, and models hallucinate at the worst possible moment. We learned to design for the mess.

## Guardrails Are Not Optional

Every production AI system we ship includes output validation, confidence scoring, and automatic fallback paths. If an agent's confidence drops below threshold, it escalates to a human or retries with a different strategy. Never ship without guardrails.

## Observability Changes Everything

You can't fix what you can't see. We instrument every inference call with latency, token usage, confidence scores, and output quality metrics. When something degrades, we know within minutes — not when a customer complains.

## Failure Modes Are Features

We design explicit failure modes into every system. Graceful degradation, automatic retries, circuit breakers, and clear error messages. A system that fails predictably is infinitely more valuable than one that fails silently.

## The 10 Million Task Mark

After processing over 10 million tasks across our product suite, the biggest lesson is simple: reliability beats capability. Users will choose a system that works 99.9% of the time over one that's more powerful but unpredictable. Build for trust first.
