Intro: GPU costs can kill an AI startup faster than bad product-market fit. Here's how we keep inference fast and costs sane across six production products.

## The Cost Problem

When you're processing millions of tasks per month, every millisecond of GPU time adds up. Naive scaling — just throw more GPUs at it — works until the invoice arrives. We needed a smarter approach from day one.

## Batching and Queuing

The single biggest win was intelligent request batching. Instead of processing inference calls one-by-one, we group compatible requests and run them as batches. Combined with priority queuing, this alone cut our GPU costs by 40%.

## Model Selection at Runtime

Not every request needs the biggest model. We built a routing layer that analyses incoming tasks and dispatches them to the most efficient model that can handle the job. Simple classification? Use a small, fast model. Complex reasoning? Route to the heavy hitter.

## Caching and Precomputation

We cache embedding vectors, pre-compute common queries, and store intermediate results. For our document AI product, this means repeat queries on the same corpus are nearly free — we serve them from cache instead of re-running inference.

## The Result

Our average cost per inference call dropped 65% over twelve months while throughput tripled. The key insight: optimise the system, not just the model.
