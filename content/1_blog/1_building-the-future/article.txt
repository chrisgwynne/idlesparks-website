Intro: The web is evolving faster than ever. Modern web architecture demands a new approach — one that balances performance, scalability, and developer experience.

## The Foundation

Every great building starts with a solid foundation. The same principle applies to web development. We've seen the industry shift from monolithic applications to microservices, from server-rendered pages to single-page applications, and now to a hybrid approach that takes the best of both worlds.

## Modern Tooling

The tools we use shape the structures we build. Frameworks like Kirby CMS provide the flexibility of a flat-file system with the power of a full content management platform. Combined with utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind, we can prototype and build at remarkable speed without sacrificing quality.

## Performance as Architecture

Performance isn't an afterthought — it's a structural requirement. Just as an architect considers load-bearing walls and material stress points, we consider bundle sizes, render paths, and caching strategies from day one.

## Looking Forward

The future of web architecture is one of composability. Headless CMS platforms, edge computing, and serverless functions are the building blocks of tomorrow's web. The blueprint is clear: build modular, deploy globally, iterate constantly.
