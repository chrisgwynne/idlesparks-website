## The Problem

Research is one of the most time-consuming knowledge tasks. Analysts spend hours searching, reading, cross-referencing, and summarising — and the output quality varies wildly depending on who does the work and how much time they have.

## How It Works

Spark Agent takes a research brief in natural language, decomposes it into sub-questions, searches across configured sources (web, internal docs, APIs), extracts relevant information, and synthesises it into a structured report with citations. The entire process runs autonomously.

## Under the Hood

Built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture with dynamic query planning. The agent uses a chain-of-thought reasoning loop with tool access — it decides what to search, evaluates results, and iterates until confidence thresholds are met. All outputs include source attribution and confidence scores.

## Results

Spark Agent produces research reports in minutes that previously took analysts 4-8 hours. Internal benchmarks show 92% accuracy on factual claims, and the system processes over 500 research tasks per day across our client base.
