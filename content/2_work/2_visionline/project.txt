## The Problem

Manual quality inspection on high-speed production lines is slow, inconsistent, and expensive. Human inspectors catch roughly 85% of defects and fatigue causes accuracy to drop further over long shifts. Our client needed a system that could inspect every single unit at full line speed.

## How It Works

VisionLine uses high-resolution cameras mounted at inspection points along the production line. Each frame is processed by a custom-trained object detection model that identifies defects, classifies their type and severity, and triggers automated sorting within milliseconds.

## Under the Hood

We trained a lightweight detection model on 50,000+ annotated defect images, then optimised it for edge deployment using ONNX and TensorRT. The system runs on NVIDIA Jetson modules mounted directly on the production line — no cloud latency, no network dependency.

## Results

Defect detection accuracy improved from 85% (human) to 99.7% (VisionLine). False positive rate sits below 0.1%. The system processes over 2 million units per month and paid for itself within 3 months through reduced waste and returns.
