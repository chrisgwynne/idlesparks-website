## The Problem

RetailStack was losing millions annually to overstocking slow movers and understocking high-demand products. Their existing forecasting relied on spreadsheets, seasonal heuristics, and gut feeling. Accuracy was around 60% — barely better than guessing.

## How It Works

PulsePredict ingests historical sales data, promotional calendars, weather data, economic indicators, and competitor pricing to generate granular demand forecasts at the SKU-location level. Predictions are refreshed daily and pushed directly into their inventory management system.

## Under the Hood

The engine combines gradient-boosted trees for tabular features with neural time-series models for capturing complex seasonality and trend patterns. An ensemble layer blends both predictions, weighted by confidence. The entire pipeline runs on Airflow with BigQuery as the data warehouse.

## Results

Forecast accuracy improved from 60% to 94% at 4-week horizon. Stockouts decreased by 45%, overstock waste dropped by 32%, and the system now forecasts across 10,000+ SKUs daily. Annual savings exceeded $4.2M in the first year.
