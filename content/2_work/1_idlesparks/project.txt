## What It Is

IdleSparks.com is the studio's own website — and it doubles as a live proof of concept. Every pixel, every layout decision, every line of CSS was produced by AI. Not assisted by AI. Produced by it. The human role was direction: describe what you want, and the system builds it.

## The Workflow

The entire site is managed through a Telegram bot connected to Claude Code, Anthropic's AI coding agent. Instructions are sent as plain messages — "add a pulsing green dot to the badge", "change the fonts to match the blueprint theme", "write a full project review" — and the AI reads the codebase, makes the changes, and commits them. A webhook on the server picks up the push and deploys automatically.

There is no FTP. No SSH sessions. No code editor open on anyone's laptop. The site is edited the same way you'd ask a colleague to fix something.

## The Stack

Built on Kirby CMS for its flat-file simplicity and PHP flexibility — no database to manage, no ORM to wrestle with. Styles are written in Tailwind CSS v4 with a custom Blueprint theme: a dark navy base with blueprint-blue grid lines, technical monospace labels, and crisp architectural typography.

Fonts were chosen to reinforce the theme. **Space Grotesk** for headings — geometric, precise, and technical without being cold. **Space Mono** for body copy — a deliberate choice to make reading feel like reviewing documentation or source code. **JetBrains Mono** for the fine-print tech labels that annotate sections like a draftsman's blueprint.

## Design Language

The visual language draws from architectural blueprints and technical drawings. A repeating grid sits behind every hero section. Section labels use a monospace uppercase style prefixed with `//` like code comments. Cards have a faint technical border that brightens on hover with a subtle glow.

The hero badge — "AI Powered Company" — carries a pulsing green dot, signalling that the system is live and online. It's a small detail, but it communicates the studio's ethos: this isn't a brochure site, it's a running system.

## Why It Matters

Most studios talk about AI. This one runs on it. The website isn't just a showcase of work — it is the work. Every update to it is a demonstration of what the studio can do for clients: automate the mundane, accelerate the deliberate, and ship without the usual overhead.

The fact that a full redesign — new fonts, a new badge, a new project entry with a live screenshot taken programmatically — can happen in a single conversation is the point. That's the capability IdleSparks brings to every engagement.
