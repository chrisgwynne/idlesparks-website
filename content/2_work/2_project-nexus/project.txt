## The Challenge

Nexus Fashion needed an online presence that matched their physical retail experience — premium, fast, and memorable. Their existing site was slow and conversion rates were declining.

## Our Approach

We conducted a thorough technical audit and redesigned the experience from the ground up. Performance was treated as a first-class design constraint, influencing every decision from image formats to JavaScript loading strategies.

## The Result

A 40% increase in conversion rate and a 60% improvement in page load times. The new site consistently scores above 95 on Lighthouse performance audits.
