## The Challenge

Vertex Industries had critical knowledge scattered across wikis, shared drives, email threads, and individual hard drives. Finding information was slow and unreliable, costing teams hours of productivity daily.

## Our Approach

We designed a centralized knowledge architecture with powerful search, tagging, and cross-referencing capabilities. The system was built to integrate with existing tools rather than replace them, reducing adoption friction.

## The Result

A platform that processes and indexes over 2 million documents with sub-second search results. Employee satisfaction with knowledge access improved by 78%, and onboarding time for new team members decreased by 35%.
