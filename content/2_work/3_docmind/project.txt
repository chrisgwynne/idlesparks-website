## The Problem

LegalFlow processes thousands of legal documents daily — contracts, amendments, filings, correspondence. Extracting key information manually was consuming 60% of paralegal time, with errors and inconsistencies creeping in across the team.

## How It Works

DocMind ingests documents in any format (PDF, DOCX, scanned images), runs OCR where needed, classifies the document type, and extracts structured fields — dates, parties, clauses, monetary values, obligations. Everything is indexed and searchable in seconds.

## Under the Hood

The extraction pipeline combines layout-aware OCR with fine-tuned transformer models for named entity recognition and clause classification. We built a custom training loop that allows LegalFlow's team to correct and retrain on edge cases without engineering support.

## Results

Document processing time dropped by 73%. Extraction accuracy on key fields (dates, parties, values) sits at 96.5%. The system processes over 15,000 documents per month and has become the backbone of LegalFlow's operations.
